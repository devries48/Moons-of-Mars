# Moons of Mars

## Description
This project is my playground to learn Unity. I love space games and space related stuff.
It is both distracting and therapeutic for me when I'm working on this project.

# Asteroids
Back in the days I didn't like to play Asteroids that much, too Difficult. Perhaps I can enjoy my own version more. 
At least I had fun creating it.
